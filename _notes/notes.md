# Notes

**The following contains many personal opinions. You can ignore it if you don't like it**

- Boilerplate or not
    - Boilerplate is only good when you already know what that boilerplate was doing. Boilerplate is always opinionated and not easy to find one that best suit you. You need to spend lots of time to find a good one.
- Typescript or not
    - Want to use this change to give vanilla javascript a try. But once I start working on stuff, missing typescript already. IDE support is the best thing that typescript can give you. IDE like VSCode can still only give you minimum support. You need to remember lots of things in mind.
    - The result I want to try without typescript is typescript requires a compiler, this extra layer sometimes cost you time to fix up something that is not part of the problem you try to solve.
